# T21-well-data-bonanza
Software Underground Transform 2021 Talk on geothermal production data and well data. All doable using Google Colab. 

<span style="color:blue"> This is going to be a viz bonanza! </span>

This is for [Transform 2021](https://softwareunderground.org/events/transform-2021), a fully online geoscience conference. The notebooks will be covering basic python syntax, packages, and basic subsurface workflows using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [welly](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/welly).

Instructions/Installation for use with [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb):

1. Make a google account, if you have a gmail, you have one! (free will work fine, no need for Colab Pro).
2. Download the t21-well_bonanza folder from this repository (green button in the upper right) and drop the t21-well-bonanza folder into Google drive (you will have to unzip it). Short gif [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5gde0jgxvclv7bn/github.gif?dl=0).
3. Install Google Colab in Google Drive (search Colaboratory in connected apps) Short gif [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nns9lq5se10fshx/colab_install.gif?dl=0).
4. This needs to be in the browser google drive, not the local folder on your hard drive.
5. Right click on the .ipynb file to open with Google Colab.
6. Run and enjoy!

## If you are an Anaconda/python pro, these notebooks should work fine!
